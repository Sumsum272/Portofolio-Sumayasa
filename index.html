			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>Hello my name is I Putu Sumayasa but I am usually called Suma or Putu. I’m 19 years old and in July on this year I will 20 years old. I have one sibling that is my little brother his name is I Kadek Rasika and I usually called him Dek Ras. My brother and me have a simmiliar face so many people always call us bye the wrong name. Even tought we are three years apart in age but I’m shorter than my brother. I really like animals so I keep many kinds of animals such as canaries,’Cerucuk’ birds and I have 5 love birds in my house and I also keep a betta fish or we usually called ‘Ikan Cupang’ and I named him Theodor. And then   If someone ask me “what’s your hobby?” I only can said “I like watch movies or drama on Netflix” but actually I have  many hobbies, such as in sport I like jogging with my friends, play badminton and play game video offcource and then in arts I usually play ‘Gender Wayang’, ‘Rindik’ or ‘Angkung’ and I also like to draw in drawing book or make a digital arts with my computer. But now I cann’t do all my hobbies freely because we are still in the Covid-19 pandemic situation. And then now I’m studying at ITB Stikom Bali and I here  I get a lot of very good friends who always help me when I’m in trouble. </p>
